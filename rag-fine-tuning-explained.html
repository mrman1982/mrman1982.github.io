            Transform generic AI into powerful, business-specific tools that understand your data, 
            speak your language, and deliver results you can trust-all while keeping everything 
            secure and offline.

          <h2>The AI Gap Your Business Can't Afford</h2>
          <p>
            You've heard the buzz about AI. Maybe you've even tried ChatGPT or similar tools. 
            But here's the reality: <strong>generic AI tools are just the starting point</strong>. 
            The businesses that will dominate in the next decade aren't just using AI-they're using 
            AI that's been specifically tailored to their industry, their data, and their unique challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two technologies make this transformation possible: <strong>RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)</strong> 
            and <strong>Fine-Tuning</strong>. If your business isn't leveraging these, you're not just 
            missing out-you're falling behind competitors who are.

          <h2>RAG: Making AI Actually Useful for Your Business</h2>
          
          <h3>What is RAG?</h3>
          <p>
            RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Think of it as giving AI access to your 
            company's "brain"-all your documents, policies, procedures, historical data, and institutional 
            knowledge. Instead of generic responses, RAG-powered AI can:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Answer questions using your actual company data</li>
            <li>Reference specific policies and procedures</li>
            <li>Provide context-aware insights based on your industry</li>
            <li>Cite sources from your internal documents</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Fine-Tuning: Teaching AI to Speak Your Language</h2>
          
          <h3>What is Fine-Tuning?</h3>
          <p>
            Fine-tuning takes a pre-trained AI model and teaches it the specific language, terminology, 
            and patterns of your industry and business. It's like hiring a specialist instead of a 
            generalist-the AI becomes an expert in <em>your</em> domain.

          <p>
            Here's the challenge with cloud-based AI: <strong>your sensitive business data leaves your control</strong>. 
            When you use online AI services, you're essentially handing over your competitive intelligence, 
            customer data, and proprietary processes to third parties.

            <p>
              RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) allows AI to access and reference your company's 
              internal documents and data, providing accurate, context-aware answers grounded in your 
              actual business information rather than generic responses.

            <p>
              Fine-tuning customises AI models to understand your industry's specific terminology, 
              processes, and requirements, dramatically improving accuracy and relevance for your 
              particular use cases.

            <summary>What kind of data do I need for RAG and fine-tuning?</summary>
            <p>
